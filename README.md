# Transformers Benchmarks

We benchmark real [TeraFLOPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS) that training Transformer models can achieve on various GPUs, including single GPU, multi-GPUs, and multi-machines. It helps you to estimate how many machine times you need to train your large-scale Transformer models. 

The real performance depends on multiple factors, including your hardware, cooling, CUDA version, transformer models, hyper-parameters such as batch sizes, and implementations. We list the numbers we got on both personal PC and cloud instances. We also provide Jupyter notebooks for you to benchmark on your machines and workloads.
